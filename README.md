This is a native Jai port (no c libraries needed, aside from the OS sockets) of the ENet reliable UDP networking library. Specifically this is of the zpl-c version that supports IPv6 and other features.

### Current state

This is still in rough shape and is not ready for production. It is currently still missing functionality and it could use a lot of work to make it Jai conformative.
